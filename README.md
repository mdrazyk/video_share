# Video Share

Video Share is a chrome plugin for downloading videos from closed Facebook groups.

Facebook closed groups don't let users download or share video content from them. It's sometimes annoying when you are browsing through meme Facebook groups, and you see a funny video that you would like to share with a friend... but you can't. Exactly that case pushed me to create the Video Share extension that lets you download or get a sharable link to any video in any closed Facebook group.

### How to use it:

## For your information:

1. Facebook video URL expires after a few hours, and you won't be able to watch the video from that link anymore. However, you can generate a new one and share it again.

2. The extension only supports downloading videos from closed Facebook groups right now. However, I might extend the functionality to support more cases in the future.

3. If you find any bug, let me know by creating an issue in my GitHub repo. I will be happy to help you :)
